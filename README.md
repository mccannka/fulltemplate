# User Experience (UX) #
For the purpose of this project, I wanted to create a single page application to test the demand for the business initially.  If there was sufficient demand, I'd look to expand the website to multiple pages.  As each business need will vary, the website aims to give a high level undertstanding of the supports the business provides, with the view that a personal consultation is needed to truly understand the benefits, which is why the website's primary call to action is to contact us.
<br>
<br>
Below are the wireframes completed to undertand the design of the single page across both desktop and mobile devices.  Key was to ensure that the main information was accessible, irrespective of the device being used.

<br>
<br>
In designing the single page I was keen that it protrayed both a professional and progressive business, therefore I needed both the colour scheme and imagery to reflect that.  Using coolors.co enabled me to select a neutral colour scheme and inturn design a brand logo which reflected that.

# Technology Used #

(1) Languages - HTML, CSS & Javascript

(2) Tools:

* <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/">Slack:</a>  Used for all communication, and researching issues faced with HTML & CSS.

* <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq Wireframes:</a>  This was used to complete initial wireframes.

* <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/">Bootstrap:</a>  To assist with responsive design and styling of key components.

* <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git:</a>  Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

# Testing #

To ensure the site contains valid HTML, the code was checked directly using validator.w3.org.  No errors were returned.
<br>
<br>
CSS for the site has also been checked via https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator and no errors returned.
<br>
<br>
The site has also been checked using Google Lighthouse, summary can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/mccannka/fulltemplate/blob/master/google-lighthouse.png">here</a>, final output following suggested amends can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/mccannka/mccann-design/blob/master/google-lighthouse-final.png">here</a>.  Chrome Developer tools has also been used to test via a range of devices i.e. Iphone, macbook and Ipad.

## Testing User Stories ##

(1) First Time User Goal:  First Time Visitors should understand the main purpose of the company.

Outcome:
* Company logo 
* Navigation with key customer objectives 
* Key call to action is to get in contact

(2) Returning visitor User Goal:  To find out the latest trends that would benefit businesses to increase their online exposure.

Outcome:
* This is an aspect which needs to be developed as the company becomes established.  Adding detailed blog content will not only benefit returning users, but would also support growth in SEO.
Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.

### Further Testing ###
* Tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
* Viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

Testing done to ensure that links work correctly & design is correct across a range of devices.
