# User Experience (UX) #
For the purpose of this project, I wanted to create a single page application to test the demand for the business initially.  If there was sufficient demand, I'd look to expand the website to multiple pages.  As each business need will vary, the website aims to give a high level undertstanding of the supports the business provides, with the view that a personal consultation is needed to truly understand the benefits, which is why the website's primary call to action is to contact us.

<br>
Below are the wireframes completed to undertand the design of the single page across both desktop and mobile devices.  Key was to ensure that the main information was accessible, irrespective of the device being used.

In designing the single page I was keen that it protrayed both a professional and progressive business, therefore I needed both the colour scheme and imagery to reflect that.  Using coolors.co enabled me to select a neutral colour scheme and inturn design a brand logo which reflected that.
